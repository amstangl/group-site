## Intellectual Community Courses
As a part of an "intellectual community" freshman have come together in the class *Drugged Society: Humanity's Long-Term Relationship with Mind-Altering Substances* to learn more about the topic. This class website shows the variety of topics students explored in Professor Kerry Michael's course. 


## Drugged Society: Humanity's Long-Term Relationship with Mind-Altering Substances
Mind-altering substances have been part of the human experience since before written history.  This IC course explored the interaction of mind-altering substances throughout history with the media interpretation of them through written responses and in-class discussions. Throughout the course of the semester, students became increasingly literate in critiquing media sources (including popular and scholarly, online and print) related to health and drug topics. This course took an interdisciplinary approach and culminated in an end of semester group project that focuses on educating those outside the course.
