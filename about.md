How do we integrate DH into the classroom in ways that are substantive, critical, and inclusive? How do we navigate the always particular and often messy challenges posed by DH instruction? This course will focus on approaches to juggling curriculum, technology, assessment, and available resources — the how’s and why’s of DH pedagogy — considered as a whole.
Each day will pair classroom-tested tools with critical approaches, through reading, discussion, and hands-on exercises. Participants will also have the opportunity to develop and receive feedback on their own digital assignments. Core to our approach will be engaging issues of accessibility and sustainability as well as the political dimensions of our tools and infrastructure. Participants will learn about common tools for digital exhibits, web-mapping, data cleanup, and collaboration. In addition, participants will leave with concrete strategies for how to incorporate these tools into their own contexts and curricula.
