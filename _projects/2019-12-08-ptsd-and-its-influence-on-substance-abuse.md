##Who Can Have PTSD?
The frightening thing about PTSD is that it can happen to anyone no matter their age or gender.  
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 7 or 8 out of every 100 people will 
experience PTSD at some point in their lives. Women are more likely to develop PTSD than 
men, and genes may make some people more likely to develop PTSD than others.[^2]
##Why is PTSD Such a Serious Thing?
Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but 
sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause many 
problems in friendships, intimate relationships, or work situations. They can also interfere with 
the ability to do normal and daily tasks.
[^3]
 According to the American Psychiatric Association, 
symptoms of Posttraumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) can be categorized into 4 different sections:
1.
   **Intrusive thoughts**
 such as repeated, involuntary memories; distressing dreams; or 
flashbacks of the traumatic event. Flashbacks may be so vivid that people feel they are re-
living the traumatic experience or seeing it before their eyes.
[^4]
2.
   **Avoiding reminders of the traumatic event** 
may include avoiding people, places, 
activities, objects and situations that bring on distressing memories. People may try to 
avoid remembering or thinking about the traumatic event. They may resist talking about 
what happened or how they feel about it.
[^4]
3.
   **Negative thoughts and feelings**
 may include ongoing and distorted beliefs about 
oneself or others \(e.g., “I am bad,” “No one can be trusted”\); ongoing fear, horror, 
anger, guilt or shame; much less interest in activities previously enjoyed; or feeling 
detached or estranged from others. 
[^4]
4.
   **Arousal and reactive symptoms**
 may include being irritable and having angry 
outbursts; behaving recklessly or in a self-destructive way; being easily startled; or 
having problems concentrating or sleeping.

##How Does PTSD Relate to Substance Abuse?
>**“52 percent of males and 28 percent of females with PTSD meet the 
>lifetime criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence”**
The symptoms of PTSD can be very hard on your mental health. Because of this added stress on 
ones’ life, many people with PTSD go to one thing to help them cope: addictive substances such 
as alcohol or prescription pills. According to Dual Diagnosis. Org, “52 percent of males and 28 
percent of females with PTSD meet the lifetime criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence, 
according to findings on posttraumatic stress disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey, 
published in 1995 in the Archives of General Psychiatry \(Kessler et al.\). When it comes to drug 
abuse, statistics from the same study show that 35 percent of men and 27 percent of women with 
PTSD meet the criteria.”
[^5]
##Why Are People With PTSD More Susceptible to Substance Abuse?
>**“The use of alcohol to numb PTSD symptoms leads to a vicious cycle. 
>Drinking alcohol worsens the fear and anxiety of PTSD, which leads to a 
>release of endorphins.”**
[^6]
According to the article *
The Role of Uncontrollable Trauma in the Development of PTSD and 
Alcohol Addiction*, 
there is a constant cycle that revolves around traumatic events and substance 
abuse. 
The first part of the cycle is when people have strong symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and 
depression due to experiencing a traumatic event. People with PTSD then often report using 
alcohol to relieve their symptoms. Alcohol may relieve these symptoms because drinking makes 
up for a shortage in endorphin activity following a traumatic experience. 
>**“Endorphins are chemicals produced naturally by the nervous system to 
>cope with pain or stress. They are often called "feel-good" chemicals because 
>they can act as a pain reliever and happiness booster.”**
[^6]
Only a few minutes after a traumatic event,  there is an increase in the level of endorphins in the 
brain. During the time of the trauma, endorphin levels remain elevated and help numb the 







emotional and physical pain of the trauma. However, after the trauma is over, endorphin levels 
gradually decrease and this may lead to a period of endorphin withdrawal that can last from 
hours to days. This period of endorphin withdrawal may produce emotional distress and 
contribute to other symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\). Because alcohol use 
increases endorphin activity, drinking following trauma may be used to compensate this 
endorphin withdrawal and thus avoid the associated emotional distress. 
[^7]
Then, the cycle 
continues from low endorphin activity to normal endorphin activity due to alcohol consumption. 
##Real People Living With PTSD
 [Buzzfeed Video](

In this video, we can see the internal struggles people with PTSD face. To recap, PTSD can 
happen to ANYONE. The video portrays this in a striking way, because the words that are being 
said are from real people. These are the confessions of war veterans and everyday people like 
you and I. In every other confession there is the fear of the stigma that revolves around PTSD. 
This stigma makes people feel more alone which in turn causes their mental health to get worse. 
This detriment in their mental health can make them turn to substance abuse, and there is this 
revolving door that circulated around PTSD. I hope that one day the stigma can go away, but in 
order for that to happen, people must be educated on PTSD and the possible negative effects it 
can have on someone. So, if you or a loved one is suffering from PTSD and substance abuse 
know that you are not alone! There are thousands of people that are struggling with the same 
thing, and there are many places to find help.

##Where Can People With PTSD Find Treatment?
There are many types of ways people can get treatment for PTSD. According to the Mayo Clinic, 
there are many types of psychotherapy options that are available. Psychotherapy is also 
characterized as a talking therapy. These types of therapies include:
1.
   **“Cognitive therapy:** 
 This type of talk therapy helps you recognize the ways of 
thinking \(cognitive patterns\) that are keeping you stuck — for example, negative beliefs 
about yourself and the risk of traumatic things happening again. For PTSD, cognitive 
therapy is often used along with exposure therapy.”
[^8]
2.
   **“Exposure therapy:**
 This behavioral therapy helps you safely face both situations 
and memories that you find frightening so that you can learn to cope with them 
effectively. Exposure therapy can be particularly helpful for flashbacks and nightmares. 
One approach uses virtual reality programs that allow you to re-enter the setting in which 
you experienced trauma.”
[^8]
3.
   **“Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing \(EMDR\):** 
EMDR combines 
exposure therapy with a series of guided eye movements that help you process traumatic 
memories and change how you react to them.”
[^8]








Other types of treatments that the Mayo Clinic stated was prescribed medications. These 
medications include:
1.
   **“Antidepressants:**
 These medications can help symptoms of depression and 
anxiety. They can also help improve sleep problems and concentration. The selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor \(SSRI\) medications sertraline \(Zoloft\) and paroxetine 
(Paxil) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) for PTSD 
treatment.”
[^8]
2.
   **“Anti-anxiety medications:**
 These drugs can relieve severe anxiety and related 
problems. Some anti-anxiety medications have the potential for abuse, so they are 
generally used only for a short time.”
[^8]
