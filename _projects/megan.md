title: Factors in Drug Addiction
---
## Introduction
Substance abuse is common among all people, all over the world. We see it in the rich, the poor, and all in between. As common as it is, substance abuse often leads to something quite life altering. [This is known as addiction](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/addiction-science). “Addictions are chronic relapsing psychiatric disorders characterized by the compulsive and dyscontrolled use of a drug or activity, with maladaptive and destructive outcomes” [^1]. However, this is not the only definition of addiction used by our society. Some view it is as a brain disease, while others view it as a failure of will or as a weakness of character. No matter which way you chose to define addiction, the truth is, is that it is hard and painful and not only for those who have it, but for the families and friends of those individuals as well. Overall, people tend to avoid the topic of addiction. Even though we see people of all statuses profiting off of drug sales more than ever; advertising companies, doctors, celebrities, drug dealers; the list goes on and on. So, even though drug abuse is not uncommon why is addiction, the most common result of drug use, rarely talked about? And why is it frowned upon by society? Well, because there’s a whole lot about it that many people don’t know, and it isn’t all that simple. [Addiction consists of many factors](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/mental-health/drug-abuse-and-drug-addictions/v/risk-factors-for-drug-use-and-drug-abuse); genetics, environment, and psychological traits are among the top three that play key roles in understanding the development of the substance abuse disorder and how at risk an individual may be for becoming addicted in the future.

## Genetics
Drug abuse starts for many different reasons. People trying to self-medicate, people in need of a way out, or even just those who like to have a good time. Nonetheless, addiction isn’t fully in the responsibility of just one person and this is partially due to genetics. “Addictions are moderately to highly heritable. Family, adoption, and twin studies reveal that an individual’s risk tends to be proportional to the degree of genetic relationship to an addicted relative” [^1]. This means that if someone within a family is an addict, everyone else is just as likely to become addicted to a substance as well. This is shocking, as it drastically changes the way in which addiction is viewed. What was once thought to be a flawed characteristic, or a weak-minded individual is no longer. “Epidemiological studies have long established that alcoholism, for example, is familial, with estimates that genetic factors account for 40-60% of risk. [...] Numerous linkage and association studies are now underway, with a view to identifying specific genetic variants that confer risk” [^6]. The reason so many studies must be done in order to result in accurate information is because addiction is very complicated in terms of finding traces of it genetically. However, this does not mean that it doesn’t exist; rather it just means that addiction is not one single gene, instead it is a combination of certain ones.

>“We all have the genetic predisposition for addiction because there is an evolutionary 
>advantage to that. When an animal eats a certain food that it likes, there is an advantage to 
>associating pleasure with that food so that the animal will look for that food in the future. In 
>other words, the potential for addiction is hardwired into our brain. [...] Although everyone has 
>the potential for addiction, some people are more predisposed to addiction than others” [^4]. 

Scientists from all over the world continue to support the claim that addiction is not just a choice, but a choice influenced largely by genetics. 

## Environment
Another thing influencing the choice to abuse drugs: an individual’s environment. This means the availability of addictive agents based on “culture, social policy, religion, economic status, and narco-trafficking”, as well as “complex diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, coronary heart disease, and AIDS” [^1]. 

>“Studies suggest that an animal's drug use can be affected by that of its cage mate,showing that 
>some social influences can enhance risk or protection. In addition, exposure to drugs or stress in 
>a person's social or cultural environment can alter both gene expression and gene function, 
>which, in some cases, may persist throughout a person’s life. Research also suggests that genes 
>can play a part in how a person responds to his or her environment, placing some people at 
>higher risk for disease than others” [^5]. 

I mean think about it, if your parents were heavy smokers or used heroin, or any other drug, the likeliness of you using drugs at any point in your life increases significantly when compared to a child growing up in a home where neither parent uses any drug of any sort. Another example of a toxic environment could be your school. If you go to a school that offers programs that inform students on drug abuse; a school that cracks down on the use of cigarettes, marijuana, etc., you are less likely to participate in drug use compared to student who goes to a school where drug use is not talked about and is not frowned upon by teachers and staff within in the school. One last environmental factor would be a child experiencing physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse or trauma. Trauma is the exposure to being or being threatened to be killed, assaulted or sexually assaulted. There is a substantial amount of evidence that proves that experiencing trauma in early childhood and adolescence puts that individual at a much higher risk for addiction to substances in adulthood. Stress in early childhood and adolescence can actually change the way the brain works. This is due to the way the brain develops under trauma and stress. It is found that with these factors, behavioral responses, decision making, coping skills, and much more may develop incorrectly, allowing for that individual to be at a higher risk of becoming addicted to drugs later in life [^2]. Sadly, it isn’t just in childhood either, trauma in adulthood is also strongly correlated with the risk of substance abuse. This is due to the fact that the person experiencing this trauma, is trying to self-
medicate and/or just get through the day. Except, a majority of the time, they don’t end up using drugs for just one day. Eventually, they begin to use it every day. This is when it becomes an addiction. The state and condition of one’s environment plays a major role in predicting and understand drug addiction, as an exposure to such abuse is not easy to ignore.

## Psychological Traits 
While understanding genetics and environmental factors are useful when trying to interpret and explain drug addiction, another factor that needs to be considered is psychological traits. These could be “stress, personality traits like high impulsivity or sensation seeking, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, personality and other psychiatric disorders” [^7]. Post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \
(ADHD\) can be added to the list as well. In an attempt to cope with difficult emotions, people tend to use drugs to ease and lessen their symptoms of a mental health problem. 

>“If you are at risk for a mental disorder, abusing alcohol or illegal or prescription drugs may 
>push you over the edge. There is some evidence, for example, that certain abusers of marijuana 
>have an increased risk of psychosis while those who abuse opioid painkillers are at greater risk 
>for depression” [^3]. 

Using drugs may be a quick fix to feeling sad or overwhelmed, but it will not solve the problem. Mental illness doesn’t just go away. If an individual chooses to self-medicate by abusing a drug for a number of years, they will become addicted and the likeliness of them ever stopping decreases substantially over time. Mental illness cannot be cured by substance abuse, rather it just adds on to the already prevalent problem. Dealing with difficult psychological traits like the ones mentioned above, puts an individual at an even higher risk to become addicted to a drug simply because the relief found in substance abuse is often far more enjoyable than any therapy or other medication offered by a doctor.

## Conclusion 
It is clear to see that addiction is anything but simple. Many factors play into how at risk an individual is for becoming addicted, whether that be through genetics, environment, or psychological factors; each aspect plays a significant role in the way we understand and view addiction. Knowing that biological factors are a predisposition for addiction eliminates the social norm that addiction is a completely voluntary choice. The idea that those who abuse drugs only to hurt their families is also inaccurate, as it is proven that drug abuse is often one’s way of treating the illness and or pain that they are experiencing from something or someone in their lives. Identifying the signs, factors, and traits that allow us to understand how one becomes addicted is essential in preventing and treating this extremely difficult and painful disorder. It may be tricky and often confusing, but addiction is not uncurable or untreatable. For further information on addiction and how it is prevented and treated, take a look at Rileigh’s article.
