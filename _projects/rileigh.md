title: Protective Factors of Addiction
---
## Can anyone become addicted to drugs?
Most professionals believe that the answer is yes [^1]. There are some drugs that are so addictive
that excessive or daily use can cause addiction in just about anyone. Despite popular belief, most
do not become addicted to a drug after trying it a single time, it typically takes multiple uses to create that craving.
## How does substance abuse begin?
Substance abuse typically occurs in those that associate with other drug users. Their susceptibility depends on the risk factors and protective factors in their environment. Those with
high levels of risk factors and low levels of protective factors often begin abusing drugs during
adolescence. The environment is the greatest factor in the initiation of drug addiction. When drugs are widely available and normalized in an environment, they are much more likely to be abused. An individual's gender, race, and geographic location also play a role. If more protective
factors are introduced in an individual’s life, addiction is much less likely.
## When does substance abuse progress into full-blown addiction?
Many may ask, what is the difference between drug abuse and drug addiction? Both terms are
used interchangeably by many. Although both certainly have adverse effects on one’s life, they
are not the same. Someone is likely abusing drugs if they still have control over their life and
they learn from the consequences of drug abuse and change their behavior. On the other hand, if
you are addicted to drugs it probably affects all areas of your life. So how does one progress
from a drug abuser to an addict? Obviously, no one intends on developing an addiction, people
often begin abusing a drug as a form of self-medicating or chasing the desired feeling that it
produces. This desired feeling is often referred to as the “Pleasure Principle”[^5]. Our brains
process all forms of pleasure the same and addictive drugs give direct access to the brain’s
reward system and encourage continued use. Of course, there are multiple factors that determine
susceptibility to addiction, those with a greater amount of risk factors and fewer protective
factors are much more likely to develop an addiction through drug abuse [^6]. As the use of the
substance shifts from a choice to a necessity, due to extended use or the addictive nature of the
drug, it becomes an addiction.
## What are factors of addiction?
There are both risk and protective factors of addiction. Risk factors are components that can
increase a person’s chance of drug addiction or abuse, whereas protective factors are components
that reduce an individual’s chance of drug addiction or abuse. Risk factors typically fall into
different categories; for example, genetic predisposition, environmental influences,
psychological factors, or the five different domains. Age is also critical, the younger an
individual uses drugs, the more likely it is that they will develop an addiction at some point in
their life. Although the risk factors of addiction are crucial, we are going to discuss the protective factors that correlate with the different risk factors.
## How do risk factors and protective factors correlate?
Basically, risk factors and protective factors are opposites. Risk factors put one at greater risk of
addiction and protective factors reduce that risk. By incorporating more protective factors into
life, the effects of risk factors are lessened and the risk of addiction can be lowered.
## What are the protective factors of addiction?
Prevention is key when it comes to drug addiction. Protective factors are simply actions or
circumstances that further prevent future drug addiction, especially for those that are already at
risk. These factors fall under the same five domains that risk factors fall under: individual,
family, peer, school and community [^6].
### Age of Abuse
 One factor that does not reside in any of the domains is the factor of age. The earlier an
individual experiences drug abuse, either by themselves or someone close to them, the more
likely it is that they will abuse drugs and develop an addiction. As a matter of fact, 90% of drug
abuse begins before the age of 18 [^4]. As a result, nearly all of the following domains correlate
strongly with adolescence. Adolescence is one of the most vulnerable periods in life, individuals
are highly susceptible to a range of influences, both good and bad. By incorporating numerous
protective factors into the lives of adolescents, their risk of drug addiction is lowered
significantly. If those around them can prevent substance abuse before the age of 18, it is much
less likely that they will ever abuse drugs at all.

### Individual
As an individual, it is important for one to understand their own identity. Being conscious of
their own family history can protect an individual from addiction. By knowing about their
genetics and understanding how they can increase their risk of addiction, individuals can take
steps to reduce their risk of drug addiction. Having knowledge of the mental health of an
individual can also make a difference. When one acknowledges any mental health issues that are
present they can be treated and learn methods of coping. After all, mental illness often leads to
self-medication [^7], but if the illness is treated an individual is less likely to rely on drug abuse
to treat their symptoms. Also, those that take actions to be more informed and connected as an
individual tend to have greater self-confidence and often engage in more meaningful activities
that even further reduce the risk of drug addiction.
### Family
 There are numerous protective factors that originate in the family as well. A strong bond
between children and their parents significantly decreases the risk of drug addiction. It is crucial for parents to take advantage of the protective factors that are possible within a family. Parents must be involved in their child’s life in order to enforce clear limits and consistently discipline their children[^6]. Another important role of parents is the prevention of trauma, childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of drug addiction. Sheltering children from harmful experiences like sexual or verbal abuse is crucial as far as protective factors go. And as expected,it is much easier for a parent to monitor their child’s behavior and watch for the warning signs of substance abuse when they have a strong bond and a trusting relationship.

dependence and psychiatric disorders”)

### Peer
Social involvement outside of the family can also have an effect on an individual's risk of drug
addiction. Especially at a younger age, the type of person that one associates with can make a big
difference. Associating with peers that are at risk of drug addiction or already abuse drugs
greatly increases the risk of drug abuse by an individual [^6]. While fraternizing with peers that
are responsible and well-behaved reduces that risk. On a similar note, frequently participating in
social events places youths at greater risk of abuse as well. By attending social events often they are more likely to attend an event that involves the use of drugs. Attending social events that do not involve drug use tends to reduce the risk of drug addiction. On the other hand, lack of social participation can also put an individual at risk as antisocial behavior can lead to mental illness or overall loneliness [^4]. Clearly, it is important for adolescents to socialize but they must choose their friends wisely to keep their risk of drug addiction low. Surely, mental illness and loneliness can lead to a search for self-medication [^8] that often leads to drug abuse.
### School
Academic competence is also important in preventing drug use. It is important for schools to take
notice of struggling students to prevent academic incompetence. By observing and addressing
aggressive behavior or poor concentration early on, educators can prevent further risk of drug
abuse [^6]. For many students, academic incompetence often sets off a chain reaction that causes
social decline, mental illness, and eventually leads to higher risk of addiction. School plays a
large role in prevention, a strong bond with their institution can prevent academic incompetence
and provide a child with more emotional and academic resources. Schools can also reduce risk
by enforcing anti-drug policies and programs. Altogether, schools can greatly contribute to the
protective factors of children and further reduce their risk of drug addiction at the present and
later in life.
### Community
The community in which an individual resides is also critical, especially when children are
maturing and learning social norms. By having other responsible adults around, besides the
parents, the support system of an individual grows. A community that is safe and sustained with
a strong infrastructure supports healthy norms and behaviors for the children that are raised
within it. Strong communities can also provide a support system for adults and reduce the
availability of drugs. Those that live in a more connected community often have a lower risk of
drug addiction because drugs are not readily available and any changes in that status would be
noticed. After all, community leaders must have a strong connection with those within their
community in order to assess any risk within it and address those risks with corresponding
protective factors and preventative services. In the end, the presence of strong community
leaders and community structure is worthwhile as it significantly reduces the risk of drug
addiction in adults and children alike.
## Conclusion
Altogether, protective factors are incredibly important for preventing addiction in both children
and adults. They fall into the five domains of individual, family, peer, school, and community.
The protective factors in a supportive environment are key to counteracting the risk factors that
are present in order to prevent any drug addictions from developing.
