title: Bipolar Disorder and Addiction
---
## Introduction
Bipolar disorder is classified as a mood disorder of which distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at least one week and present most of the day, nearly every day or any duration if hospitalization is necessary [Medicaid Mental Health] (http://www.medicaidmentalhealth.org/_assets/file/Guidelines/2017-2018%20Treatment%20of%20Adult%20Bipolar%20Disorder.pdf).To diagnose bipolar disorder, your doctor will need to perform lab tests, a psychiatric assessment, and mood charting to track your mood, sleep patterns, or other factors that could help with diagnosing and help find the proper treatment[Mayo Clinic] (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bipolar-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355961). 
Due to the nature of bipolar disorder, it may come as no shock that many of the people diagnosed with bipolar disorder also face addiction and substance abuse disorder.

## Categories of Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder has two categories: bipolar 1 and bipolar 2. Those with bipolar 1 experience more manic episodes while bipolar 2 is the opposite: having more major depressive episodes. It is also common for those with bipolar disorder to self-medicate or stop taking prescribed medication when in a manic episode due to their elevated mood. It is common for the person diagnosed with bipolar disorder to feel like they are on top of the world while in a manic episode and may lead to reckless drug use.
## Substance Abuse Disorder and the Link between Bipolar Disorder
The correlation between bipolar disorder and addiction and drug usage is high. A shocking 70 percent of people who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder also have a history of substance abuse, exceeding the general population. Substance abuse affects the outcomes of bipolar disorder in several ways: Bipolar disorder is a disorder that causes rapid mood changes for days/weeks and typically leads to more risky behavior. Impulsivity is common for those suffering with bipolar disorder, which can lead to impulsive drug use.
## Statistics of addiction among sufferer of Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar Disorder has a significant increased risk of addiction because of their mania, where they feel at the top of the world and that nothing can touch them when it comes to dangerous activities, as spoken about early. Some of the most common drugs, such as nicotine and alcohol, are abused because of how easily accessible the drugs are. According to [Mental Illnesses: Descriptions, Causes, and Treatments]( https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/morrismn-ebooks/reader.action?docID=3019854&ppg=48),
…More than 40 percent of the cigarettes smoked in the United States are smoked by individuals with a psychiatric disorder, such as major depressive disorder, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder…

## Alcoholism
It’s not just cigarettes people with bipolar disorder become addicted to. Alcohol is another popular drug of choice. According to [AddictionCenter](americanaddictioncenters.org/bipolar-and-addiction), “…a study of people with bipolar disorder, approximately 60 percent had some history of substance abuse”. That is astounding how high the rate drug abuse is among mood disorders. It is very hard to treat a person with a mood disorder who also suffer with substance abuse disorder. How do we treat this horrible mixture?
How do we stop a person from self-medicating? It is extremely common for people with bipolar disorder to stop their medications and take it upon themselves to self-medicate, whether in a depressive or manic episode.
## The effects on families and friends
It is important we treat bipolar disorder at the source but even then, there is no guarantee the person won’t try drugs/drink alcohol. However, these drugs have serious and long-lasting effects on the families, friends, and person with the disorder. According to Bryan K. Tolliver, MD, PhD, an addiction psychiatrist at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, "Bipolar patients who use [alcohol or drugs] have more frequent mood swings, more hospitalizations, longer hospitalizations, and higher rates of suicide attempts." (Booze, Drugs, and Bipolar Disorder)
This is important to keep this information in mind as we think about how/if we can intervene. Addiction treatment starts at intervention.
## Bipolar Disorder Intervention
Bipolar disorder treatment is tricky and hard to spot at first. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry says that most people with bipolar disorder receive treatment at least six years after their first episode. Because of this delay, symptoms become more extreme and relapse becomes more frequent. Intervening during the early stages could prevent unnecessary delays and expedite the recovery process [American Addiction Center](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/bipolar-and-addiction).
## Bipolar Disorder Counseling
As one might expect, cognitive behavioral (or talk) therapy involves one-on-one sessions with a therapist or groups (such as family, friends, relationships). Therapy may help the person with bipolar disorder and their loved ones better understand their disorder and the therapist will teach coping mechanism. Therapy for bipolar disorder is step number one in the hard journey of addiction recovery.
## Substance Abuse Disorder Counseling
The person with bipolar disorder and substance abuse disorder hold a lot of pressure on their shoulders. The assigned counselor will customize the intervention and counseling the person goes through. The counselors focus on triggers and map out how to best overcome their addiction and how to stay drug-free. A person may go through the program multiple times
## Treatment
There is no one-size-fits-all type of treatment and that makes it even more challenging to find and stick to a single treatment program. Given that nobody has one set way, there are many different forms of therapy. Here are a few of the many types of therapy:
**Contingency management** uses positive reinforcement such as providing rewards or privileges for remaining drugfree, for attending and participating in counseling sessions, or for taking treatment medications as prescribed.
**Motivational enhancement therapy** uses strategies to make the most of people's readiness to change their behavior and enter treatment.
**Twelve-step facilitation (TSF)** is an individual therapy typically delivered in 12 weekly session to prepare people to become engaged in 12-step mutual support programs. 12-step programs, like Alcoholic Anonymous, are not medical treatments, but provide social and complementary support to those treatments. TSF follows the 12-step themes of acceptance, surrender, and active involvement in recovery.[Drug Abuse](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/treatment-recovery) Every addict is different, therefore each addict should know all of the different types of therapy.
## Ending 
It is important we talk about these heavy issues, most importantly to stop bipolar disorder in its earlier stage before the symptoms worsen. One step is a call to action and a normalization of the issue’s sufferers. People with bipolar disorder and addiction must deal with a huge amount of pressure. Substance abuse disorder plays a dangerous game with bipolar disorder. It’s important we talk about such issues like these two mental disorders because every day we go ignorant to such disorders is another day that an alcoholic or drug addict with bipolar disorder goes without treatment.
