title: Non-Prescription Drugs & Mental Illnesses
---
This page is about a connection between non-prescription drugs and mental illnesses
 
# Introduction 
Non-prescription drugs, including alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs have extensive relationships with mental illnesses. One major reason people use non-prescription drugs is for fun rather than for self-medication. A few questions you may ask yourself when reading this may be, are there differences between people who use drugs recreationally versus to self-medicate for mental illnesses? Does drug use cause mental illness, or do mental illness increases the risk of drug abuse? Or both? 

## Biological Mechanisms 
An article in *Journal of Affective Disorders* by Gomez-Coronado focuses on four specific hypotheses explaining the interrelationship between drug use and mental illness. The first hypothesis states, “The self-medication hypothesis consider drug use to be the result of an attempt to alleviate pre-existing symptoms of a mental disorder,” while a second hypothesis argues that, “repeated drug administration leads to neuronal adaptation in brain areas mediating mental illness.” The third hypothesis proposes that, “both disorders share neurobiological vulnerability.” The fourth hypothesis illustrates that, “SUDs and mental illness have functionally discrete neurobiological mechanisms.” [^1] Evidence suggests that intermittent stressors, mood episodes, and substance use not only show sensitization to themselves, but cross-sensitization to others contributing to a mental illness. Infographic statistics can also represent cross-sensitization when abusing key substances that can have major effects on a person’s body and mental health. 

## Popular Statistics 
*The National Survey on Drug Use and Health* [(NSDUH) is the primary source for statistical information on illegal drugs, alcohol use, substance use disorders, and mental health issues for the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States.](https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm). According to the NSDUH, “In 2017, the percentage of adolescents aged twelve to seventeen who used illicit drugs in the past year was higher among those with a past MDE than it was among those without a past year MDE.” [^2] MDE stands for major depressive episode. **29.3%** of people had a major depressive episode and used illegal drugs compared to **14.3%** of people who didn’t have a depressive order. The substance with the largest number of recent initiates of use were alcohol, marijuana, prescription pain relievers, and then cigarettes. Around **8.5 million** adults aged eighteen or older had both a mental, behavioral, and emotional disorder, and a substance disorder in the past year of 2017. Most of these patients who are suffering both of these symptoms don’t seek treatment. *Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration* (SAMHSA) mentions that, “1 in 12 US adults had a substance use disorder in the past year whereas 1 in 5 adults had any mental illness, and as a total, 7.9 million adults had both.”

## Developing a Mental Illness
According to *The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)*, “Many people who have a substance use disorder also develop other mental illnesses, just as many people who are diagnosed with mental illnesses are often diagnosed with a substance use disorder.” [^3] Although you don’t start with a mental illness, a person is most likely to develop one because of their substance use such as drugs or alcohol. This is also known as a comorbid substance use disorder. Comorbidity describes two or more disorders or illnesses occurring in the same person. One of the common risks factors that play a role in a comorbidity disorder can connect with a person’s gene. Genes can influence how a person responds to a drug whether or not using the drug makes a user feel good. *NIDA* also states, “People with mental illnesses may use drugs or alcohol as a form of self-medication.” [^4] This is caused mainly because of a lot of genes that can increase the risk for both a mental illness and a substance use disorder. A brief overview of one example of a risk factor would be if a person frequently used marijuana as a child. Another possibility that contributes to the risk of developing both a substance use disorder and a mental illness is how the substance use can change the way your brain in ways that make a person develop a mental illness. These are just a couple of risk factors that you should be aware of when it comes to a mental illness and a substance use disorder. 
 
## Comorbid Disorders & Drug Abuse 
According to the *NIDA*, “Many people who regularly abuse drugs are also diagnosed with mental disorders and vice versa.” [^5] One interesting factor that plays a role in drug abuse would be your gender. The overall rates of abuse and dependence for most drugs are higher among males rather than females. Males tend to suffer from antisocial personality disorder, while women have higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders, all which are still risk factors for substance abuse. Mood and anxiety disorders play a huge role with users who abuse drugs. *NIDA* will allow the reader to look at the comparisons of someone who has any mood or anxiety disorder and take certain drugs compared to all of the respondents. An example of self-medication would be the use of tobacco products by patients with schizophrenia, which is believed to reduce the symptoms of the disease. 

## Infographic Bar Graph
A website titled, “The Arbor Behavioral Healthcare” did a dual diagnosis referring to individuals who suffer from both an addiction and a mental illness. In this article, it mentions the National Alliance on Mental Illness and states how “about a third of people who suffer from mental illness also deal with addiction issues.” [^6] This website presented a bar graph giving an example of substance use among adults aged eighteen or older, by any mental illnesses. The highest percentage of **25.8%** dealt with someone who has a mental illness as well as abuse substance use such as illicit drugs. 

![An infographic bar graph representing the connection between adults who abuse substances and have a mental illness](http://archive.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k10MH_Findings/2k10MHResults.htm#Ch4) 

There were seven different categories of percentages that adults aged eighteen or older had a mental illness from abusing either: illicit drugs, marijuana, psychotherapeutics, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, and heroin. This chart showed that people who have a mental illness, tend to abuse substances such as drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. For every category, the percentage was always higher for someone who was dealing with a mental illness. According to the *NSDUH*, only **7.7%** of those co-occurring conditions receive appropriate dual diagnosis treatment.” [^7] [NSDUH mentions Johnson’s page on addiction treatments](http://archive.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k10MH_Findings/2k10MHResults.htm#Ch4).
 
## Conclusion
From research, it has been shown that non-prescription drugs and mental illnesses have a substantial relationship with each other. From my data, I have suggested that most people who do abuse drugs, tobacco, or alcohol have a mental illness or will eventually be diagnosed with the disorder. Overall, people who are fighting this problem seem to rarely or never seek help. There are many treatments in this world that can be done to reduce this problem, but people seem to either be ashamed of it or can’t emotionally tell themselves to stop.
