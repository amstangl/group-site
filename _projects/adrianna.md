Understanding different treatment options and how family and friends can help someone with addiction.

## Drug Addiction
Drug addiction is a topic many people can relate to, whether on a personal level, or knowing someone who has been affected by it. People begin using drugs for a variety of different reasons, but many find they have become dependent on various substances and find that their lives have forever changed. Even if someone wants to quit using, it is not that simple. Drug addiction takes ahold of a person’s life and changes it forever. However, help and resources are out there offering out a helping hand to whoever may need it, it’s just a matter of knowing where to start looking.

# The Main Types of Drug Addiction Treatment
Rehabilitation is generally the first thing people think of when they think about seeking out help for a drug addiction. While this is a common practice, it is more complex than anyone may think. Often times, before rehabilitation, detoxification of the body occurs. This first step rids the body of harmful substances and takes a medical approach towards treating addiction. The National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA) explains this thought and how this helps lessen the negative effects of stopping drug use. While detoxification effectively rids the body of these substances, there is another side of addiction that many people do not always think about. NIDA[^1] goes on to express this issue, “Detoxification alone does not address the psychological, social, and behavioral problems associated with addiction and therefore does not typically produce lasting behavioral changes necessary for recovery. Detoxification should thus be followed by a formal assessment and referral to drug addiction treatment;” this is where drug addiction treatment comes into play.

## Long Term Residential Treatment
While the name indicates much of this type of treatment’s approach, there is more to know about long term residential treatment. Typically, when someone is admitted into a residential facility, they will be in anywhere from six to twelve months at a time, where they will receive care around the clock. NIDA[^1] describes the approach of long-term treatment as, “focusing on the "resocialization" of the individual and use the program’s entire community—including other residents, staff, and the social context—as active components of treatment. Addiction is viewed in the context of an individual’s social and psychological deficits, and treatment focuses on developing personal accountability and responsibility as well as socially productive lives.” The treatment itself is flexible to fit the individual’s needs and provide them with the tools needed to get back on their feet and living life fully once again.

## Short Term Residential Treatment
Much like long-term care, short-term treatment is trying to regain the social aspect of people’s everyday lives as well as providing them with the resources needed to get better. However, in a short-term residential treatment facility, patients are admitted for three to six weeks instead of the six to twelve months typical to long-term treatment. Typically, after this shorter stay, the individual is to “remain engaged in outpatient treatment programs and/or aftercare programs. These programs help to reduce the risk of relapse once a patient leaves the residential setting,” (NIDA[^1]). 

## Outpatient Treatment Programs
Another approach to drug addiction treatment is outpatient care. This is typically more cost effective and allows for more of a regular lifestyle during the process. Individuals are able to adjust this program to fit their needs at the time. Other health issues may be addressed alongside the treating of drug addiction.

## Counseling
Counseling is an integral part of the process of drug addiction treatment and rehabilitation. One can find this in many forms, some of which include group and individual counseling. Taking a look into the individualized drug counseling, NIDA[^1] explains this approach as, “Not only focusing on reducing or stopping illicit drug or alcohol use; it also addresses related areas of impaired functioning—such as employment status, illegal activity, and family/social relations—as well as the content and structure of the patient’s recovery program.” Much like the short-term residential treatment, this approach typically follows a twelve-step treatment plan. The main goal behind individual counseling is to help the individual learn to cope with day to day life and avoid the temptations of using drugs. The other approach tends to be group counseling. This method uses socialization and the support of other people in similar situations to help seek out a healthy, clean lifestyle. The social aspect is a key part within addiction, so for those who are struggling, building connections makes them feel less alone and gives them hope and a support system.

# How Family and Friends Can Help 
Often times when someone begins the road to recovery from a drug addiction, people view this as a personal and individual journey. While it is very individualized and personal, that does not mean they should have to walk alone. Family and friends play a huge role in people’s lives, especially a recovering addict. Understanding and knowing how to start that conversation and offer a helping hand can make all the difference in someone’s life.

## Initiating Conversation
People tend to be scared of starting up a conversation with people who they see struggling. However, initiating that conversation may be what that individual needs at this point in their life. It is important that they see that someone cares about them and their future. Here are a few quick tips from The Partnership [^2]and Behavioral Health Evolution [^3] for initiating that conversation.
-Do not initiate this conversation when you yourself, or the person of concern is under the influence of any kind and if need be, seek out help for yourself before helping others.
-Create a welcoming environment and conversation where the person feels as if they can converse and be heard in a loving environment. Listen to them and build up trust.
-Explain and show that you care about the individual. Express love and compassion, even if it is difficult. Getting upset and/or mad will tend to push the individual away and they will tend to shut people out. Understand that they may be in denial, not ready to talk yet, or even just feeling unmotivated or skeptical of the idea of reaching out for help.
-Do not expect immediate change. Offer them help, but know that progress is not linear and it is different for everyone.
