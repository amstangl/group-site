# The Illegal Drug Trade into America: The War on Drugs

Cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, marijuana and more, are all being transported into the United States by high-end illegal drug cartels. The illegal drug trade and the War on Drugs has been a great problem for America, along with other countries like Mexico and Colombia. These large drug cartels and organizations have been taking over areas to produce, store, transport, and distribute illegal drugs across borders and into other countries. Fighting against the War on Drugs, the American government has responded to drug violence by assisting other countries to fight against it; roughly eight billion dollars’ worth of assistance. [^1] Adding to the cause of violence, the highly demanded drug market is one of the main components in the drug trade. Illegal drug trafficking has brought hundreds to millions of pounds and tons of illegal drugs into the United States for the high demanding, addicted (Hyperlink to whoever’s paper is about addiction), drugged society. These illegal drug substances are going all around the globe, but as a student working with fellow classmates, the focus will be narrowed to the United States.

## What is it?

The four main substances of the illegal drug trade are cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana. The first substance, cocaine, comes usually in one of two forms; a white powder that is typically snorted through the nasal cavity, or as a rock called [crack](https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/crackcocaine.html) that is smoked from a pipe. The actual cocaine is extracted from a plant called Coca, where only one half of 1% of each coca leaf is pure cocaine. [^2] Coca is most commonly grown in Colombia, grown by local farmers. With more than one thousand tons of cocaine produced per year and over two million dealers’ worldwide, there is $51 billion worth of cocaine going across the border into the United States. [^2] Even though cocaine usage has dropped steadily by 40% from 1999 to 2009 in the United States, Americans still consume about 63% of cocaine available. [^1] With [methamphetamine](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/methamphetamine), dealers push roughly ten pounds of meth a day in the United States. [^3] Marijuana is not as large of a problem as it was a decade ago with the rise of legalization and decriminalization. Marijuana (Hyperlink to “Teens and Marijuana Use” paper) is, however, still being trafficked across the border with more than 3.3 million pounds into Phoenix, Arizona. [^3] Cocaine, meth, heroin and marijuana are not just magically appearing in the United States, but instead are being brought in from other countries.

## Where is it?

Cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana are essentially going everywhere around the globe. The United States is, however, the largest consumer market with a large demand for these illegal substances. [^1] In the United States, Phoenix, Arizona is one of the wholesale capitals of America; Phoenix being the starting line for drugs into the rest of America. [^3] On the other side of America, New York is considered the cocaine capital. [^2] A large sum of the illegal drugs are transported from Mexico across the border into the United States. Mexico produces about 9% of the heroin supply that is trafficked into the United States. [^1] Most of the product made, however, is not from Mexico, but from Columbia. Over half of the cocaine production comes from Columbia, where poor farmers harvest the coca leaves. [^3] Along with drugs, violence broke out in Columbia, and consequently for America, trafficking and violence shifted from Colombia into Mexico. [^1] Cartels and organizations are also now moving, but instead are going into Central America to take advantage of the weaker states to run cartel drug businesses; the process is also known as the balloon effect. [^1] All in all, Mexico and Columbia are the main regions that bring cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana into America by illegal drug trafficking.

## The interworking’s of the drug trade

Illegal drug cartels are large organizations that require a lot of people in order to work efficiently. Every position in the illegal drug trade is essentially important, from the drug lords and bosses like Pablo Escobar to the small street dealers and users. In different areas, crew bosses run towns and cities with their own crews of 8\-10 men. Each crew runs a different element of the supply chain such as transportation, distribution, money laundering, and security. [^3] Transportation consists of different positions such as cartel mules, footmen, packers, and ground support. Cartel mules drive different vehicles carrying drugs or weapons from one area to another. Footmen and packers transport and smuggle drugs by foot through remote areas across the border, carrying drugs and supplies in tightly wrapped packages on their backs. Ground support are the people who pick up the footmen and packers at the established pick-up areas while supplying them with enough food, water, and other supplies needed or wanted. Other positions in the drug cartel with distribution are the dealers that break up drugs into individual packaging and the foot soldiers who deal directly to the streets. The cartels security have hitmen who enforce the laws of the drug cartel that find people who owe money and usually kill them if they do not pay back the debt owed. [^3] Finally, the largest part of the drug trade are the users; the ones who buy and use the illegal drugs distributed across the United States.

## What is being done?

The American government and task force have been acting against the War on Drugs. Part of the discussion was debating about different approaches such as harm reduction, decriminalization and legalization. [^1] Decriminalization, legalization, and the distribution of marijuana (Hyperlink to “Legalization of Marijuana” paper) has already been in discussion in the last several years. However, the discussion concerning other, more dangerous drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin are less likely to follow the path of legalization and decriminalization. Since many of these illegal drugs are criminalized, there are more than “a million people in prison on drug related charges.” [^2] In 2009 alone, there were more than 1.8 million people arrested on drug related charges. [^2] In Columbia, there are reinforcements by Special Forces officers that will go on daily missions to find and destroy drug laboratories to stop further production of drugs. [^2] Along with reinforcement, the US government has put “five billion dollars to eradicate missions” to try and reduce cocaine production in Columbia by 50%. [^2] Adding to missions and imprisonment, there is also strict controls on the boarder, within airports, and on the water with enforces, such as the coast guard, to try and stop the transportation of illegal drugs into the country. Even with all the effort by the government to stop the War on Drugs. More and more drugs are still being made, transported, sold and used in America. Throughout all of history, there has never been a “drug free-society.” [^5] The real challenge in society is to “learn how to live with drugs.” [^5] In order to make society more efficient in lowering drug trafficking and usage, drug policies (Hyperlink to “Drug Policy and Drug Scheduling” paper) need to change. Most of the United States drug policies seem to “emphasize crimination over health.” [^5] Throwing users into jail will not help the person with addiction or society. (Hyperlink to “Risk Factors and Protective Factors of Addiction” paper) Instead of going to jail, the users and addicts should be put into medical treatment and or rehabilitation (Hyperlink to “Mental Health and Addiction” paper). Treatment and prevention (Hyperlink to “Different Methods Used to Treat Drug Addiction and What is Most Effective” paper) are what should be encouraged, [^4] because imprisoning drug users has been proven to be ineffective. [^6] If illegal drugs began to be legally regulated and taxed, then most criminalized drugs would “radically reduce crime, violence, corruption,” and would “improve public safety.” [^5] Overall, the government is setting foot to try and help the American people to overcome addiction, but with over crowding jails and not the proper treatment of users, there will be no improvement in society unless something is changed.
