## The Impact of Opium on the Environment
The most known thing about drugs and what most people talk about, is how they affect the brain. One thing that is also important, but not discussed as much is how drugs impact the environment. Such as, how opium can have an effect on the brain in multiple ways but, how it influences the environment is not as well known. 

## What opium is
To start off, Opium is a narcotic drug that is acquired from opium poppy seeds. Opium is used for many other products such as morphine, heroin, and codeine /(The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica/). These drugs made from opium are called opiates. 

## History of opium (growing)
Opium was discovered fairly early, “the earliest reference to opium growth and use is in 3,400 B.C.” (/Cannabis, Cocoa, & Poppy)/. “The opium poppy was native to what is now Turkey,” /(The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica)/ and spread across the land eastward. The demand of opium was slow but it grew popular once they discovered of smoking it like tobacco. Although, intake of opium was firstly by either being put in a beverage or taken as a pill. By the time this plant grew a little more famous, farmers took to the ideal lands needed for them to thrive. Once the crop is ready, the farmer takes his “opium to the nearest village where he will sell it to the dealer who offers him the best price” /(Cannabis, Cocoa, & Poppy)/. 

## Cultivating and harvesting opium
At the start of the growing season for opium, farmers break up the soil to place the seeds in. Opium seeds range in color from white, yellow, gray, black, and so on /(U.S Department of Justice 10)/. As the plants grow, farmers will weed and thin the plants until they fully mature. When the opium plants are mature, they “range between three to five feet in height,” /(U.S Department of Justice 9)/ at this time the famers can start to harvest them. Once harvesting time comes around, farmers have to, what they call scoring or tap, the pods with a small blade so the opium will drip out but not flow too fast /(U.S Department of Justice 10)/. The opium pods “will secrete opium for several days,” /(U.S Department of Justice 10/) until the plant is completely drained of the wet opium. Raw wet opium tends to be a brown color to which farmers will let dry for a few days until needed for further use /(U.S Department of Justice 10)/.  

## How it effects the environment
One main product produced from opium poppy seeds is morphine. The environmental effects of producing, molding the material, and packaging it can contribute to climate change. A study done in Australia measured the amount of CO2 emissions from producing morphine and packaging it from opium poppy farms. Researchers measured 100mg in 100mL and determined that the “morphine sulfate had a climate change effect of 204g CO2 approximating the CO2 emissions of driving an average car 1 km,” /(McAlister)/. They noted in their conclusion that the “final stages of morphine production, particularly sterilisation and packaging, contributed to almost 90% of morphine's carbon footprint,” /(McAlister)/. Growing opium had minor effects on the environment, the issue comes more so from processing and packaging the drugs made from opium. 
##Opium has become a higher demand and those who are cultivating and harvesting opium have gained more land area over time. This deforestation process is causing loss of habitats and lessens biodiversity in these areas (/McSweeney 13)/. Certain regions become defenseless against “destructive flooding, tropical storms, and drought that are predicted to increase under most climate change scenarios,” /(McSweeney 13)/. Without environmental protection, the farming of drug crops could wipe out some fundamental territories. 

## How opium effects the people cultivating/harvesting
Harvesting opium is a lot of hard and tedious work for the farmer. Opium is usually a large business which has many employees that become accustomed to it /(Booth)/. Cultivating and harvesting opium plants can be “an exhausting, back-breaking and labour-intensive process which can really only be done by hand” /(Booth)/. Working on the fields, doing the same thing can get to a person. After a while, “the typical coolie found himself doing mind-numbing work in a barbarian land, bored and homesick,” /(Courtwright)/. After a while sometimes the workers “turned to the opium pipe,” /(Courtwright)/ to take some of the edge off. These farmers have to go through a lot of painstaking work which can drive them to use their own product. 

Although opium can be used for multiple things, the process of growing and harvesting it impacts the environment. Opium effects our planet in many different ways. From the CO2 emissions to the deforestation process to create more farmland, these factors can result in certain environmental issues as well as effecting the workers.
